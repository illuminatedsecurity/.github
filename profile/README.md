# Illuminated Security Teaching Resources

Welcome to the [Illuminated Security](https://illuminated-security.com/) Github account!

Here you can find all the public resources associated with our [application security and applied cryptography courses](https://illuminated-security.com/courses). All of these resources are free to use and open source under a permissive license. That means you are free to use them even if you haven't paid for a course. If you like these resources, please consider paying for a training courseâ€”we think they are the best in the business and it helps us produce more free resources for the community.
